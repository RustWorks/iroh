/// The purpose of this trait is to hoop up a node discovery mechanism that
/// allows finding information such as the derp url and current addresses
/// of a node given the id.
///
/// To allow for discovery, the [`super::MagicEndpoint`] will call `publish` whenever
/// discovery information changes. If a discovery mechanism requires a periodic
/// refresh, it should start it's own task.

    /// This is fire and forget, since the magicsock can not wait for successful
    /// publishing. If publishing is async, the implementation should start it's
    /// own task.
